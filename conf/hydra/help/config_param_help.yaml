  To run the app for a defined configuration by running with multirun -m flag.:
  1. python run_main_demonet.py -m mode=lab prompt=prompt1 parameters=param1
  This will generate outputs for defined constants, dt, iter_max and S_IC.
  
  You can also run the app for a defined mode to give outputs for the other configurations by running:
  2. python run_main_demonet.py -m mode=lab

  Similarly, you can run the app for a defined dt and S_IC to give outputs for other defined iter_max by running:
  3. python run_main_demonet.py -m mode=lab prompt=prompt1
